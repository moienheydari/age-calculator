## Overview

### The challenge

Users of this site can:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April) (V2.0)
- See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted (V2.0)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size (Full Responsiveness)
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
